Project #3: Design and implement an embedded, stand-alone QNX Neutrino program 
to generate a 1.0 kHz square wave (50% duty cycle) on the parallel printer port using 
QNX Neutrino delay and timing primitives. Using the program from Project #1, measure 
the interarrival time variations between rising edges of the generated square wave and 
tabulate 1000 interarrival times. You may wish to update your measurement program 
from Project #1 to increase it’s accuracy (i.e. use timer interrupts.)
